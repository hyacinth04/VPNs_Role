#  VPNs: Core Role in Security and Privacy
This document summarizes the core function, technical features, benefits, and limitations of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) based on a practical analysis.


#  Functionality and Verification

A practical test using Windscribe demonstrated the VPN's primary functionality of 

**`IP masking`**: The connection successfully concealed the user's real location, instead showing the IP address 

**146.70.250.6** originating from Hong Kong.

The test confirmed the expected 

**`Performance trade-off`**: A slight reduction in network speed was observed due to encryption overhead, confirming that increased latency and processing load are expected for enhanced security. Crucially, the VPN client managed the tunnel effectively and 

**Did not leak the original IP address** upon explicit disconnection.

# Key Technical Features

A VPN's true value is defined by its security protocols and client safeguards.

* **` The newer WireGuard`**: This protocol is recognized for its superior speed and efficiency and use of modern cryptography like ChaCha20, contrasting with the mature but generally slower OpenVPN protocol.

* **` The No-Log Policy`**: a guarantee not to record user data or browsing history, ensures activity remains untraceable.

* ** `The Kill Switch`**: an automatic safety net that instantly blocks all internet traffic if the encrypted connection fails, preventing the exposure of the user's real IP and data.

#  Benefits and Limitations Summary

VPNs offer several key advantages:

* Benefits: Enhanced security (by encrypting all data, particularly on public Wi-Fi), true privacy through IP masking, the ability to bypass geo-restrictions and censorship, and ISP throttling prevention.

* Limitations: The performance trade-off of reduced speed/increased latency, the fact that a VPN is not total security (it can't stop malware or phishing), the possibility of being blocked by certain high-security services, and the need for fundamental trust in the provider to genuinely adhere to their No-Log Policy.
