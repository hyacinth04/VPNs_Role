Project Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for the "Role of VPNs in Privacy and Secure Communication" mini-guide assignment. The project involved both a practical demonstration of establishing and testing a VPN connection and a technical analysis of the underlying security features and protocols.

The final deliverable is a comprehensive report detailing the steps taken, the observations made, and a summary of VPN benefits, limitations, and key technical specifications.

Deliverables
1. Final Report

Key Findings
------

Category |  Finding

Masking Success  |  Successfully masked the local IP address, reporting a location in Hong Kong.

Performance  |  Observed a slight, expected reduction in speed due to encryption and distance.

Key Features  |  Analysis focused on the security benefits of the Kill Switch and No-Log Policy to prevent data leaks and maintain user anonymity.

Protocols  |  Contrasted the speed/efficiency of WireGuard with the flexibility/trustworthiness of OpenVPN (AES-256).
